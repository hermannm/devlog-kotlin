   * Emulates a `when` expression for all the possible variants of [LogLevel].
   *
   * If we made [LogLevel] an enum or a sealed class, we could have exhaustive `when` expressions
   * without an `else` branch. However, that would freeze the current members of `LogLevel` as part
   * of our public API, as introducing new members would break compatibility. Library consumers
   * should only be using log levels as constants to pass to the library, so we don't want to expand
   * our public API needlessly like that.
   *
   * But since we now lose exhaustive `when` checks, we need an `else` branch. This `else` branch
   * will always be unreachable as long as we check all the levels defined on the companion object
   * here - since the constructor is private, there will be no other instances. To keep this logic
   * in one place, we provide this method to emulate a `when` expression on a log level:
   * - We take a lambda parameter for each log level, to ensure that all cases are covered
   *     - We make the method `inline`, so we don't pay a cost for the lambdas
   * - In the unreachable else branch, we throw an exception
   *
   * We may be able to use an enum/sealed class instead if
   * [this issue moves along](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-38750/Support-declaration-site-nonexhaustiveness-for-enums-and-sealed-classes).
