/**
 * A logger provides methods for logging at various log levels ([info], [warn], [error], [debug] and
 * [trace]). It has a given logger name, typically the same as the class that the logger is attached
 * to (e.g. `com.example.ExampleClass`), which is added to the log so you can see where it
 * originated from.
 *
 * The easiest way to construct a logger is by providing an empty lambda argument:
 * ```
 * private val log = Logger {}
 * ```
 *
 * This will automatically give the logger the name of its containing class. If it's at the top
 * level in a file, it will take the file name as if it were a class (e.g. a logger defined in
 * `Example.kt` in package `com.example` will get the name `com.example.Example`).
 *
 * Alternatively, you can provide a custom name to the logger:
 * ```
 * private val log = Logger(name = "com.example.Example")
 * ```
