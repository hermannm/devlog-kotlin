/**
 * The purpose of [LogBuilder] is to build a log event. We could store intermediate state on
 * `LogBuilder`, and then use that to construct a log event when the builder is finished. But if we
 * instead construct the log event in-place on `LogBuilder`, we can avoid allocations on the hot
 * path.
 *
 * SLF4J has support for building log events, through the [org.slf4j.event.LoggingEvent] interface,
 * [org.slf4j.event.DefaultLoggingEvent] implementation, and [LoggingEventAware] logger interface.
 * And [LogbackLogger] implements `LoggingEventAware` - great! Except Logback uses a different event
 * format internally, so in its implementation of [LoggingEventAware.log], it has to map from the
 * SLF4J event to its own event format. This allocates a new event, defeating the purpose of
 * constructing our log event in-place on `LogBuilder`.
 *
 * So to optimize for the common SLF4J + Logback combination, we construct the log event on
 * Logback's format in [LogbackLogEvent], so we can log it directly. However, we still want to be
 * compatible with alternative SLF4J implementations, so we implement SLF4J's format in
 * [Slf4jLogEvent]. [LogEvent] is the common interface between the two, so that [LogBuilder] can
 * call this interface without having to care about the underlying implementation.
