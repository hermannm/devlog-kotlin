/**
 * Adds the given [log fields][LogField] to every log made by a [Logger] in the context of the given
 * [block].
 *
 * An example of when this is useful is when processing an event, and you want the event to be
 * attached to every log while processing it. Instead of manually attaching the event to each log,
 * you can wrap the event processing in `withLoggingContext` with the event as a log field, and then
 * all logs inside that context will include the event.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import dev.hermannm.devlog.Logger
 * import dev.hermannm.devlog.field
 * import dev.hermannm.devlog.withLoggingContext
 *
 * private val log = Logger {}
 *
 * fun example(event: Event) {
 *   withLoggingContext(field("event", event)) {
 *     log.debug { "Started processing event" }
 *     // ...
 *     log.debug { "Finished processing event" }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The field from `withLoggingContext` will then be attached to every log, like:
 * ```json
 * { "message": "Started processing event", "event": { /* ... */  } }
 * { "message": "Finished processing event", "event": { /* ... */  } }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Note on coroutines
 *
 * `withLoggingContext` uses a thread-local, so it won't work with Kotlin coroutines and `suspend`
 * functions (though it does work with Java virtual threads). An alternative that supports
 * coroutines may be added in a future version of the library.
