/**
 * Class used in the logging methods on [Logger], allowing you to add structured key-value data to
 * the log by calling the [field] and [rawJsonField] methods.
 *
 * This class is given as a receiver to the lambda arguments on `Logger`'s methods, which lets you
 * call its methods directly in the scope of that lambda. This is a common technique for creating
 * _type-safe builders_ in Kotlin (see the
 * [Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#function-literals-with-receiver) for more
 * on this).
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * private val log = getLogger {}
 *
 * fun example(event: Event) {
 *   log.info {
 *     // This lambda gets a LogBuilder receiver, which means that we can call `LogBuilder.field`
 *     // directly in this scope
 *     field("event", event)
 *     "Processing event"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

   * Adds a [log field][LogField] (structured key-value data) to the log.
   *
   * When outputting logs as JSON, this becomes a field in the logged JSON object (see example
   * below). This allows you to filter and query on the field in the log analysis tool of your
   * choice, in a more structured manner than if you were to just use string concatenation.
   *
   * The value is serialized using `kotlinx.serialization`, so if you pass an object here, you
   * should make sure it is annotated with [@Serializable][kotlinx.serialization.Serializable].
   * Alternatively, you can pass your own [serializer] for the value. If serialization fails, we
   * fall back to calling `toString()` on the value.
   *
   * If you have a value that is already serialized, you should use [rawJsonField] instead.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```
   * import dev.hermannm.devlog.getLogger
   * import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
   *
   * private val log = getLogger {}
   *
   * fun example() {
   *   val event = Event(id = 1001, type = EventType.ORDER_PLACED)
   *
   *   log.info {
   *     field("event", event)
   *     "Processing event"
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * @Serializable
   * data class Event(val id: Long, val type: EventType)
   *
   * enum class EventType {
   *   ORDER_PLACED,
   *   ORDER_UPDATED,
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This gives the following output (using `logstash-logback-encoder`):
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "message": "Processing event",
   *   "event": {
   *     "id": 1001,
   *     "type": "ORDER_PLACED"
   *   },
   *   // ...timestamp etc.
   * }

  /**
   * Adds a [log field][LogField] (structured key-value data) to the log, with the given

   * choice, in a more structured manner than if you were to just use string concatenation.
   *
   * By default, this function checks that the given JSON string is actually valid JSON. The reason
   * for this is that giving raw JSON to our log encoder when it is not in fact valid JSON can break
   * our logs. So if the given JSON string is not valid JSON, we escape it as a string. If you are
   * 100% sure that the given JSON string is valid and you want to skip this check, you can set
   * [validJson] to true.
